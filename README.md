Batch-delete computer records from your Jamf Protect tenant. This macOS app provides a fast UI to fetch stale devices by last check‑in or import a CSV of serial numbers, review the list, and safely delete in bulk.

### Status

This is an actively maintained fork of the original project by red5coder, with ongoing improvements to UX, reliability, and safety.

- Original repository: [red5coder/Jamf-Protect-Batch-Delete](https://github.com/red5coder/Jamf-Protect-Batch-Delete)
- Current status: beta (use with care; test in non‑production first)

## Features

- Fetch computers that have not checked in for a chosen timeframe (7–360 days or 0 days)
- Import a CSV of serial numbers (single column, no header)
- Search, sort, and select/deselect in a table view
- Bulk delete with confirmation dialog
- Optional Keychain storage for the API password
- Unified Logging integration for audit/troubleshooting
 - Non‑blocking progress overlay showing overall status (Queued/Running/Success/Failed)
 - Per‑item status updates in the table (Queued/Running/Retried/Failed/Success)
 - Retry failed items with exponential backoff
 - Error banner with expandable details and “Export failures CSV”
 - Export successful deletions to CSV (toolbar button and File → Export successes CSV)
 - Dark Mode and VoiceOver support

## Requirements

- A Mac running macOS Ventura (13), Sonoma (14), or Sequoia (15)
- Xcode 15 or newer (tested on recent Xcode versions)
- A Jamf Protect tenant
- A Jamf Protect API client with permissions:
  - Read and Write for Computers
  - Read and Write for Alerts

## Install / Build

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open `Jamf Protect Batch Delete.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3. Select the `Protect Batch Delete` scheme.
4. Build & Run. Grant Keychain access on first run if you choose to save the password.

You can also Archive from Xcode to create a signed app for distribution in your organization.

## Configure

You will need the following from your Jamf Protect environment:

- Jamf Protect URL (e.g., `https://your.protect.jamfcloud.com`)
- API Client ID
- API Client password

Ensure the API client has the permissions listed in Requirements.

## Usage

1. Launch the app and enter your Protect URL, Client ID, and Password.
2. (Optional) Enable “Save Password” to store the password in Keychain.
3. Choose a "Not Checked‑in" range and click "Fetch" to pull devices from Jamf Protect.
   - Or click "Import CSV" to bring in a single‑column list of serial numbers.
4. Use search, sort, and selection tools to review the list.
5. Click "Delete Selected" and confirm to proceed.

### During and after a run

- While deleting, a non‑blocking overlay shows overall progress; the table’s Status column updates per item.
- On completion:
  - If any items failed, a completion overlay appears with actions: Retry failed, Export failures CSV, Export successes CSV, Dismiss.
  - A top error banner summarizes failures and can expand to show detailed errors; it remains until dismissed.
  - If no items failed, the completion overlay is suppressed, but you can still export successes from the toolbar or File menu.

### Exporting results

- Export failures: use the button in the error banner or completion overlay.
- Export successes: use the toolbar button or File → Export successes CSV (⇧⌘E).

### CSV format (example)

```text
ZRFN72C5GI
ZRFN63C5GJ
ZRFN91C5GH
```

### Logging

The app writes to macOS Unified Logging. To stream logs:

```bash
log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "co.uk.mallion.jamf-protect-batch-delete"' --level info
```

### Screenshot

## Security & Privacy

- The URL and Client ID are saved to `UserDefaults` for convenience.
- If you enable “Save Password”, the password is stored in your Keychain under the service `co.uk.mallion.jamfprotect-batch-delete`.
- Deletions are permanent in Jamf Protect. Perform a small test first and consider exporting a list of devices before bulk actions.

### App Sandbox permissions

The app uses App Sandbox with “User Selected File Read/Write” so save/open panels can read and write files the user chooses. If you see “Unable to display save panel…” in a custom build, ensure your target’s entitlements include:

```xml
<key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key><true/>
<key>com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write</key><true/>
<key>com.apple.security.network.client</key><true/>
```

## Troubleshooting

- 401/403 authentication errors: verify the URL, Client ID, and password; confirm API client permissions; ensure the URL includes `https://` and your correct tenant domain.
- No results when fetching: try a different last check‑in range; confirm devices actually meet the criteria.
- CSV import issues: ensure the file is plain text CSV with a single column of serial numbers and no header row.

## Roadmap

See detailed priorities, acceptance criteria, and UI flows in `ROADMAP.md`.

- Safer dry‑run preview before applying deletions
- CSV export of fetched computers and selected deletions
- Enhanced filters (check‑in ranges, alert state, hostname/serial patterns)
- Further refinements to progress UI and error reporting
- Keyboard shortcuts and accessibility improvements
